A machine learning model that predicts loan defaults using Random Forest, with behavioral insights and risk scoring.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts **loan defaults** using **Random Forest** and behavioral insights.  
It assigns a **risk score (0-100%)** to each borrower based on **financial history, debt ratio, and payment behavior**.  

🔹 **Key Features:**
- 📊 **Predicts loan defaults** based on borrower risk profiles.
- 🎯 **Risk scoring system (0-100%)** to assess creditworthiness.
- 🏦 **Behavioral insights**: late payments, high debt ratio, credit utilization.
- 📈 **Optimized Random Forest Model** with hyperparameter tuning.
